<h3><a name="Palo">How to compile and run C programs in your computer</a></h3>
<ul>
<li> You can write C programs using a simple editor if you have a linux 
or MacOS system. You can also use IDEs (Integrated Development 
Environments), however you have to resolve any issues with IDEs on your 
own. This is a masters level unit and I would expect a high level of 
independence from you. </li>
<li> If you have a Windows system, there are ways of using linux from the Windows OS, for example <a href="https://www.onmsft.com/how-to/install-ubuntu-on-windows-10-or-windows-11"> here </a> and there are many other suggestions on the Internet that you can explore. </li>
<li> The simple way to compile a C program from command line is to use 
the gcc compiler from the command line. For example, if your program 
file is <tt>myProg.c</tt>, you can use <tt>gcc myProg.c</tt> to generate an executable file called <tt>a.out</tt> and execute it. You can also give a specific name to your executable file, for example <tt>gcc -o myProg myProg.c</tt> will create an executable called <tt>myProg</tt>.
</li><li> Don't despair if you don't know the C language. I will cover 
it in the lectures quickly, and would expect you to pick up based on 
your experiences with other programming languages. You can also look up 
the lecture notes for week2 from the "Lectures" folder. 

</li></ul>

<h3><a name="Palo">Timing of C programs</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>When we try to improve the run time performance of our programs, we have to 
know how much time our program takes to execute. C has several ways of 
determing the execution time of programs. Your first task is to 
read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5248915/execution-time-of-c-program">this discussion</a> and understand how you can determine the execution 
time of your C programs. 

<p> While <i> stackoverflow</i> is a very useful discussion site for C 
programming, it is your responsibility to check whether the discussed 
codes are correct or not. You can also use other sources from the internet 
for your understanding. </p></li>

<li> Your computer is so fast that you need to do a lot of computations 
for the time to be measurable. First try to write simple loops that execute 
many times,e.g., start with several hundred thousand iterations and increase 
the number of iterations gradually. You need not have any statements inside the loop. </li>

<li> Now plot the running times against the number of iterations in a graph. 
You can use Microsoft Excel. Does the time increase linearly? In other words, 
is the increase in time proportional to the number of iterations? </li>

<li> Now write a program that does something non-trivial inside a loop. For 
example, declare a large enough array and store random floating point numbers 
between 0 and 1 in the array. Now add these floating point numbers in the loop. You can see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/822323/how-to-generate-a-random-number-in-c">this discussion</a> for random number generation. </li>

<li> Write the bubble sort algorithm in C and check timing with larger and 
larger input sizes. There are many sources that you can look up for the bubble sort algorithm, starting from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">Wikipedia article</a>. </li>

<li>Write the quicksort algorithm in C and check timing with larger and 
larger input sizes. There are again many sources that you can look up for 
the quick sort algorithm, starting from 
<a href="https://www.cquestions.com/2008/01/c-program-for-quick-sort.html">
here</a>. However, you have to modify this code to input large arrays. </li>

<li> There are many other sorting algorithms like <i>merge sort</i> and 
<i>insertion sort</i>. Search the internet for C codes for these 
algorithms and do a timing analysis with varying input sizes. Which 
algorithm is the fastest? 
</li>
<li><b>Note:</b> There is a limit of how large an array you can allocate
in a C program statically. This is because there is a limit on the size 
of an activation record on the stack (you can watch the video on "Stack 
and Heap" that I have posted). Most of the time you will get a run-time 
"segmentation fault" error if you allocate too large an array. You have 
to experiment and see how large an array you can allocate without 
segmentation fault. This situation can be avoided if one allocates 
arrays dynamically, since that storage is allocated in the heap. </li>

</ul>

<!--<h3><a name="Palo">Timing of FORTRAN programs</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>When we try to improve the run time performance of our programs, we have to
know how much time our program takes to execute. FORTRAN has several ways of
determing the execution time of programs. Your first task is to
read <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/CPU_005fTIME.html">this discussion</a> and understand how you can determine the execution
time of your FORTRAN programs. </li>

<li> Your computer is so fast that you need to do a lot of computations
for the time to be measurable. First try to write simple loops that execute
many times,e.g., start with several hundred thousand iterations and increase
the number of iterations gradually. You need not have any statements inside the loop. </li>

<li> Now plot the running times against the number of iterations in a graph.
You can use Microsoft Excel. Does the time increase linearly? In other words,
is the increase in time proportional to the number of iterations? </li>

<li> Now write a program that does something non-trivial inside a loop. For
example, declare a large enough array and store random floating point numbers
between 0 and 1 in the array. Now add these floating point numbers in the loop. You can see <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gfortran/RANDOM_005fNUMBER.html">this discussion</a> for random number generation. </li>

<li> Sorting is the process of arranging a set of numbers in either ascending or descending order. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort">Bubble sort</a> is one of the simplest (and so efficient) algorithms for sorting. Your task is to understand the bubble sort algorithm and test its performance on larger and larger input sizes.  
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19550621/fortran-bubble-sort-algorithm">Here is an implementation</a> of Bubble sort in FORTRAN which you can use.
One of the ways of generating large inputs is to generate random numbers. </li>

<li><b>Note:</b> See the note above for C programmers. I expect this will not be a problem with the Gnu Fortran compiler, as the Gnu Fortran compiler allocates automatic (or static) arrays in the heap.</li>
