## Labs for CITS5507 High Performance Computing

This repo tracks my attempts to complete the lab exercises from CITS5507.

The files for each lab will be in a directory called `lab{n}`. Each lab should have a `Makefile` which generates the source code file to do the exercises.

All source code is formatted with `clang-format` using the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)

In some labs I use Python and Jupyter notebooks for visualising results. If you wish to run these notebooks, install the requirements listed in `requirements.txt`.
